    /* 
        The setup function needs to create the logic for a checkbox. 
        The logic for a checkbox is:
            1. Each box must have a list of child elements (this list can be null)
            2. Each box must have a parent element (this can also be null)
            3. Each box must have a state (checked, unchecked, intermediary)

        There must also be a function that handles state changes
        checkboxClickHandler () {
            This function needs to do the following:
            1. Search the node list of child elements 
        }
